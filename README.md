This code makes a basic Tic-Tac-Toe console game where a board is layed out using an array. 
Each slot is numbered and can be replaced by X and O. 
The player chooses whether they are going to be X or O and the computer is assigned the opposite. 
The game can be reset after the board is either filled or there is a winning combination.
